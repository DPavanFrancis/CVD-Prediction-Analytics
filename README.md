1.1 Overview:
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the most dangerous or fearful diseases which is taking more than 17.3 million lives every year all over the world and numbers are expected to grow by 23.6 million deaths per year by 2030. It is said that heart diseases are more prevalent in men than women. 
Compared to different continents people in Asia are more likely to succumb to death due to CVD compared to others. According to WHO it has been estimated that 24% ofdeaths in India are due to CVD.CVD is an umbrella term under which there are groups of disorders that are related to heart and blood vessels. Many of these disorders are conditions called atherosclerosis. In this condition walls of arteries build up fatty plagues which causes narrowed or blocked blood vessels that may lead up to 
different Cardiovascular diseases.
The prevalence of its associated risk factors has been found to exist increasingly in the population.With such a fast pace of increasing incidence, a number of epidemiological studies have been carried out in India to trace the prevalence of CVD over time. Some of them have forecasted the future incidence and prevalence of CVD in India.
With the increase in cases numbers of epidemiological studies have been carried out in India to trace the prevalence of CVD over time. It is the first among the top 5 causes of death in the Indian population. In 2000, there were an estimated 29.8 million people with CVD in India out of a total estimated population of 1.03 billion or a nearly 3% overall prevalence.
CVD comprises many different types of conditions. Some of these might develop at the same time or slowly develop into other conditions or diseases within the group. 

#Diseases and conditions that affect the heart include: 
Angina: A type of chest pain that occurs due to decreased blood flow into the heart
Arrhythmia: or an irregular heartbeat or heart rhythm
Congenital heart disease: in which a problem with heart function or structure is present from birth 
Coronary artery disease: slows blood flow to your heart muscle, so it doesn’t get the oxygen it needs.
Heart attack: A sudden blockage to the heart’s blood flow and oxygen supply
Heart failure: wherein the heart cannot contract or relax normally etc..,

#Problem Statement:

Readings of patients are given and the objective is to build an application to classify the patients to be healthy or suffering from cardiovascular disease based on the given attributes. People with high readings of CVD factors owith high risk of Cardiovascular disease need early detection and management where machine learning models can be of great help.

#Data Definition
The dataset represents features features of patients. The data definition is as follow: ----Age: Age of the patient (integer)

----Height: Height of a person in cm (interger)

----Weigh:Weight of a patient in Kg (float)

----Gender:gender of the patient (categorical code) 1-women,2-men

----Systolic blood pressure: ap_hi (int)

----Diastolic blood pressure: ap_lo (int)

----Cholesterol: cholesterol 1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal

----Glucose:glucose levels 1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal

----Smoking: whether a patient smokes or not (binary) 1-smokes,2-doesn't smoke

----Alcohol intake: whether a patient consumes alochol or not (binary)1-alcoholic,2-non-alcoholic

----Physical activity: whether the patient actively participates in physical activity or not (binary) 1-does physical activity,2-doesnt do physical activity

----Presence or absence of cardiovascular disease: Target variable(binary) 1-Presence of the disease,2-Absence of the disease
